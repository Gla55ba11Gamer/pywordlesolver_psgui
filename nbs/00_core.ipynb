    "In part it is intended to help cheat on future wordles, but more importantly for me, it is a working intro to python packaging with nbdev, git, github, githubpages etc ... ieNEWBie. So please, lower your expectations now. Why? Because this is how I really like to learn new stuff. It might even stray to inefficiency if I'm trying out an element of Python I've not worked/played with enough.\n",

    "**WORDLE - IMPLEMENTED RULES AND DEFAULTS**\n",
    "\n",
    ">[Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle) \"is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle, and owned and published by The New York Times Company since 2022. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. The mechanics are nearly identical to the 1955 pen-and-paper game Jotto and the television game show franchise Lingo. Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, this package loads an English language file string, and uses the five-letter, six guesses rules. However, these should be extended in the future.\n",
